First, install the cli app using npm or yarn.

It is recommended to install the CLI tool globally :

```shell
npm install -g @underbase/cli
```

You can also install the package locally :

```shell
npm install -D underbase
yarn add underbase --dev
```

### Verify installation

```shell
underbase --help
# npx underbase --help
# ./node_modules/.bin/underbase --help
```

It should returns the help message.

See [module usage](module-usage) to learn how to use the library as a module.
